The course will also discuss different types of sensors and how they can be integrated into a circuit."
ELEC 3020 - Embedded Controllers II,                                This course builds upon knowledge gained in Embedded Controllers I. Students will develop IoT devices using industry standard languages such as C/C++ and Python and more advanced I/O devices and sensors will be examined and a number of IoT protocols will be used for device-to-gateway and device-to-server communication.
INFT 3010 - Capstone Project I,"                                Working within teams, students will integrate skills and knowledge to develop a real world IoT project using an agile framework to manage it effectively and regularly present their work to peers for feedback."
INFT 3020 - Capstone Project II,"                                Building on a minimal viable product, students will integrate skills and knowledge from previous courses to continuously improve their project and add additional functionality. Students will also explore manufacturing, entrepreneurship, and service-learning applications of the project."
INFT 5500 - Work Experience,"                                This course is either a campus-based or external applied learning experience which may consist of work experience, directed studies, industry projects or applied research."
ISEC 3010 - IoT Security,"                                This course introduces students to issues related to securing IoT devices and the networks that host them. Students will examine networked IoT devices, operating systems, and protocols and discuss common vulnerabilities and exploits."
MOBI 3000 - Mobile Development,"                                Students will develop applications for popular mobile devices that will be used to view the status of an IoT device, read the device’s inputs and control the device’s outputs. Applications will be written for modern Android and/or iOS devices."
NETW 3012 - Cloud Services,"                                Students will learn how to connect electronic devices and sensors to cloud services to store data, visualize the data in different ways and monitor real-time information. They will also examine the current protocols used to communicate to the cloud, how to ensure the data is secure and how to host a personal ""cloud"" to build a complete end-to-end system."
OSYS 3012 - Embedded Operating Systems,                                This course examines the details of various embedded and real-time operating systems. Students get hands-on experience with several embedded operating systems and the specialized hardware used to run them and learn to assess the requirements of specific applications within the constraints of embedded hardware. Various case studies will be used to demonstrate course concepts.
PROG 3011 - Embedded C,"                                This is a C programming course with a hardware focus. Students will learn the basics of the language using a PC, but will begin by using embedded devices (RPi, Arduino, PICs) to see the differences in development processes. Students are assumed to have programmed previously in both Java and Python. Advanced programming concepts, such as debugging and troubleshooting techniques are also covered."
PROG 3012 - IoT Programming with Java Script,"                                This course introduces students to the JavaScript language and its application in monitoring and controlling IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Students will create responsive web-based user interfaces to control connected devices and be introduced to popular JavaScript libraries and environments, such as Node.js, Node-Red and IoT.js."
SAFE 1000 - Introduction to WHMIS (Workplace Hazardous Materials Information Systems),"                                This course offers learners basic overview of WHMIS principles and establishes a solid foundation to support workplace-specific training on the safe storage and handling of controlled/hazardous products. Upon successful completion of the course, students receive basic WHMIS certification."
SAFE 1001 - Introduction to NS OH&S Act,"                                This course offers students an introduction to the Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Act of Nova Scotia, which is required by any person employed in a Nova Scotia workplace. This is a generic, introductory course that provides basic knowledge of the Act for students and is considered to be the basis from which more specific training can be given."
